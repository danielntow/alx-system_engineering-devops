# Processes and Signals

## Overview

Processes are running instances of programs on a computer system. Each process has a unique Process ID (PID) and can be managed by the operating system. Signals, on the other hand, are notifications sent to processes to convey events or requests for specific actions.

## Key Concepts

### Processes
- **PID (Process ID):** Unique identifier assigned to each process.
- **Foreground vs. Background Processes:** Foreground processes run directly in the terminal, while background processes run independently.
- **Process Management:** Starting, stopping, and monitoring processes using commands like `ps`, `kill`, and `top`.

### Signals
- **Types of Signals:** Signals like SIGKILL, SIGTERM, SIGINT convey different events or requests to processes.
- **Sending Signals:** Using commands like `kill` or `pkill` to send signals to specific processes.

## Usage

- **Monitoring Processes:** Use `ps` command to list running processes.
- **Killing Processes:** Use `kill PID` to terminate a specific process by its PID.
